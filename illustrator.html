          In this project, I used illustrator to make a park sign poster for
          Chesepeak Bay. I learned a lot more about the different tools, and the
          capability with adobe ilustrator. It got me out<br />
          of my comfort zone and I'm hapy with the turnout.

          I and a group were tasked on making icons for zoo exhibits. We each
          took an animal and I chose the lion. It had to be appealing to all age
          groups and distunguishable enough to know what they are. I was just
          getting started with illustrator and found my footing with this
          project. It was simple, yet complex enough for me to explore pens,
          brushes and ways to color on it.

          With the social justice poster there was a lot of room to experiment.
          I chose domestic violence because people dont know that it's a problem
          that affects many people. The bars on the house represent how you can
          feel trapped in your own home, because vicims of abuse are often cut
          off from people they were close to and can't reach out to anyone about
          getting help. I played around with gradients in the sky and on the
          bars to make it look more metalic, and put a special texture on the X.

          This project was to pick a random word out of a hat, and illustrate it
          with the letters. My word was jumbled, and I tried multiple ideas
          before I started on this one. It took lots of patience entering in all
          of the individual shapes at the end, but I think it was worth it. It's
          the supposed to be the word jumbled up in a jar.
